# Telegram Bot on Azure function (serverless)

This project is aimed at demo Azure services.

## Planning bot

+ The bot should be _**reliable**_. To ensure our bot is always prepared to handle incoming messages, we aim to leverage
  the reliability of our cloud provider to the fullest extent possible.
+ The bot should be _**scalable**_. Our goal is for the bot to scale to meet demand, up to the limits of our budget.
+ The bot should be _**cost-effective**_. It doesn’t matter if you create this bot to learn something new or create it
  to run in a production environment. We want to spend as less money as we can.
